## About 

#### Research question

Question: Can we make an unbiased emotion recognition tool?

Our project attempts to use existing facial recognition software for the implementation of a comprehensive emotional recognition system that accurately identifies emotions in a diverse population using. primarily use Google Collab and Tensorflow to build our program. This is an exciting opportunity to explore the more human elements of a highly technical process. The challenge of developing a program that can attempt to understand a piece of the intricacies of human emotion is both new and important to us.

#### Goal 
our goal for a minimum viable product was a locally run program that can identify at least one emotion: happiness. Given the project's time constraints, we planned to prioritize the accuracy and cultural sensitivity of the identification over the volume of emotions the program can identify. To demonstrate our findings, we created a report which outlines the way displaying emotions differs throughout people, our processes, and our results.
